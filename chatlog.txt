hello!!!!!!!!!
finally this program works!
i fixed a bug
and i've added some example programs, let me paste them here :O
i made the code a bit bigger, i think it will be faster
uh not really
FASTER!!!
for me it's like 2x fastr
should we try some new programs i made?
ok NOW its more faster
OH YEAH
if you add more b and Os to the program it becomes more faster
oh yeah because you make more bits (b) at a time :O
hold on imma make the "fastest" version of the screensaver program
ohhok!
oh look at this blinky dinky blinky switchy blinker in the shell
holy fuck i made the program too large
WOOSH
ok...should work...
oh i know whats the cause lemme fix it
i think it only did it 1 time and then it stopped
maybe because it was too big?? idk
fixed!
look! :O
OMG ITS SO FAST!!!!
i somehow see a sea-like pattern -> OMGG TRUE
it generated a lot of them at a time
I SEE A STARFISH
NOW I SEE A SKULL

what if i take the output this program made, and replaced the 0s or 1s with spaces? we could see so much stuff :O
i've did it! ill Send it on ds
